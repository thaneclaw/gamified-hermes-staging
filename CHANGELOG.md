## [Unreleased] — staging

_Nothing pending._

---

## [v1.6] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Square camera publish:** guest cameras now publish 1:1 square (`aspectratio=square`) with `contenthint=detail` and 30fps cap. Saves upload bandwidth vs 16:9 since OBS uses square cutouts. Only affects guest iframes, not host or overlay.
- **OBS Source Record setup guide:** `docs/obs-source-record-setup.md` documents guest ISO recording via OBS Source Record plugin.

### Added
- **Two-layer OBS architecture:** overlay system split into `/underlay` (beneath camera layers) and `/overlay` (top-layer, above all sources)
- **Chat-to-screen feature:** producer can select chat messages and push them to the top-layer overlay as styled on-screen text graphics with neon glow ring and Gamified branding
- New `OverlayRoute.tsx` for top-layer overlay (chat-to-screen card)
- New `UnderlayRoute.tsx` (renamed from old `OverlayRoute.tsx`)
- Two-iframe architecture on producer panel: existing data-only codirector iframe + new chat-only iframe for VDO.Ninja chat reception
- `ChatToScreenEvent` and `ChatToScreenClearEvent` on P2P data channel
- Underlay/overlay route split in `App.tsx` with `React.lazy`
- **Tracker always visible:** tracker section renders on `/play` and `/chat` at all times. Empty state shows "WAITING" header with "Waiting..." placeholders. Never hides.
- **Tracker on chat routes:** `ChatRoute` now listens for `rosterUpdate` and `trackerUpdate` events and renders a `TrackerBar` component. Sends `getRoster` on mount for late joiner sync.
- **Tracker persistence:** committed tracker stored to `gamified.tracker.v1` in localStorage. Producer refresh restores the last sent tracker. Late joiners after a producer refresh receive the correct state.
- **Effective label sync:** `PlayRoute` maintains `effectiveLabel` state updated from `rosterUpdate`. Local chat messages, card sender, emoji sender, header display, and featured chat attribution all use the producer-set name instead of the stale URL param.
- **Chat-to-screen on `/chat`:** `ChatRoute` can feature messages to the overlay.
- **Producer mute controls:** mute/unmute buttons for individual guests plus mute-all/unmute-all in the producer panel. Uses existing `muteGuest`/`unmuteGuest` events. Producer mutes are mic-control only (no SILENCED overlay for individual mutes; mute-all shows the visual on the underlay).
- **Popcorn emoji:** added to chat emoji picker (24 total). Heart eyes removed. Clown moved to row 3 first for visual balance.
- **Clickable chat links:** URLs in chat are now cyan and underlined, rendered via `src/lib/linkify.tsx`.
- **Sanitize module:** shared `sanitizeForOverlay` extracted to `src/lib/sanitize.ts` for PlayRoute and ChatRoute.
- **Payload validation hardening:** emoji events validated against `EMOJIS` set, `from` sender field validated on emoji and cardPlay, `rosterUpdate` and `cardReset` field validation, `trackerUpdate` title type check, `chatToScreen` author length cap (64 chars).

### Fixed
- **STFU sender cooldown:** the guest who plays STFU now gets the 10s cooldown locally. Previously, VDO.Ninja doesn't echo P2P events back to the sender, so the sender's WRAP IT UP button stayed available while all other guests were locked. Extracted `startStfuCooldown` helper called from both `onMessage` and `playCard`.
- **STFU cooldown timer accuracy:** cooldown now uses absolute expiry time (`cooldownEndsAtRef`) instead of decrementing state. Delayed interval callbacks in OBS CEF no longer extend the cooldown past 10 real seconds.
- **STFU auto-unmute:** after STFU expires, `reconcileMic` now actively sends `mic: true` to unmute the guest, unless the guest self-muted (dog barking, cough). Previously guests stayed muted after STFU because nothing sent the unmute command.
- **STFU circuit breaker speed:** re-assert interval reduced from 500ms to 150ms. Tightens the gap between STFU card play and actual mic silence.
- **Self-mute tracking:** `selfMutedRef` tracks manual mic mutes via VDO.Ninja's `mic-mute-state` event (both directions). Prevents force-unmuting a guest who muted themselves when STFU or host-mute clears.
- **SILENCED overlay bookkeeping:** individual unmute after mute-all now clears both "host" and "muteall" reasons. `guestSelfUnmuted` clears "host" and "muteall" but never "stfu". Prevents stale SILENCED overlays.
- **Mute-all no longer affects host:** mute-all and unmute-all skip the host seat. Host mic is controlled independently.
- **Mute state sync:** producer and host mute states now stay in sync. Previously they could drift if one panel muted and the other didn't reflect it.
- **Late joiner tracker sync:** `lastTrackerRef` initialized from localStorage (not null). `getRoster` handler always re-broadcasts tracker state. `clearTracker` stores empty state (not null).
- **Chat scroll:** removed smart auto-scroll (nearBottom check) from PlayRoute ChatPanel and ChatRoute ChatFeed. Always pin to newest message.
- **Chat-to-screen backdrop:** ambient backdrop now fades in/out in sync with the card. No more visual pop on entry or exit. CardPill backdrop removed entirely; card self-handles readability.
- **Featured message truncation:** `join("…")` was inserting the ellipsis between every character, producing H…e…l…l…o. Fixed to join with empty string and append … at the end.
- **Featured message clear:** clearing a featured message now fades out over 400ms instead of vanishing instantly. Uses `fadeOut` keyframe + `cleared` flag on the sprite.
- **Label dedup aliases:** removed duplicate "cry" and "lmao" aliases that mapped to two different emojis.
- **Underlay roster cache:** underlay loads cached roster from localStorage for instant display before `getRoster` reply.
- **Underlay getRoster on mount:** underlay sends `getRoster` on mount (1.5s delay) so refreshed underlay shows correct names in card announcements.

### Changed
- `/overlay` route now points to the NEW top-layer overlay, not the original underlay
- Existing OBS browser source should be renamed from `/overlay` to `/underlay`
- New OBS browser source pointing to `/overlay` should be added at top of source stack
- Page title changed from "Game Show Control Deck" to "Gamified"
- `CardColor` type removed from `cards.ts` (unused, colors are inline in cardThemes)
- Dead CSS keyframes removed from `index.css` (~400 lines: `slamIn`, `shake`, `flashOnce`, `flashRed`, `floatUp`, `pulseGlow`, `spin`, `buzzPulse`, `buzzRing`, `arrowUp`, `arrowDown`, `bannerSwap`, intro keyframes, MVP keyframes, `timerPulse`, `sentimentNumberFly`, `sentimentDialHide`, `silencedRingPulse`)

---

## [v1.5] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Card play glow rework:** `SourceAura` changed from inset shadow to outset glow with gold border ring, higher opacity (0.95/0.70/0.45/0.25), 3s duration
- **STFU silenced effect (Aria v2 spec):** rebuilt with layered approach — base wash `rgba(35,35,42,0.72)`, radial vignette, pink accent tint `rgba(255,46,107,0.12)`, pulsing pink border ring (`silencedRingPulse` keyframe), SILENCED label with entrance animation
- **Host tracker:** producer can type answers per seat and send to host display via `trackerUpdate` event. Host sees a 2x3 grid below buzzers with guest names + answers, styled with dark cards (#0e0e16) and Orbitron font
- **Producer panel reorder:** roster > buzz board > reset cards > host tracker > activity feed > calibration
- **Buzzer timer:** increased from 120s to 300s (5 minutes)
- Activity feed logs tracker send/clear events
- Uppercase answers on host display

### Changed
- STFU overlay color revised through multiple iterations — from flat gray to Aria's radial gray wash (`rgba(100,100,108,0.55)` center fading to `rgba(45,45,52,0.92)` edges)
- Host mute uses audio-only muting (no SILENCED overlay visual, since host mic is independent of the STFU card system)
- Card box styling: `overflow:hidden` + `borderRadius` on `cardBoxStyle`
- Dim wash: `rgba(20,18,25,0.55)` for subtle background dim

### Fixed
- STFU overlay no longer uses `mix-blend-mode: saturation` (doesn't work across OBS browser sources)
- SILENCED overlay correctly clips to rounded camera corners
- Host mute no longer triggers visual SILENCED overlay (only STFU card does)

---

## [v1.4] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Source Aura:** gold inset glow ring on the card player's tile (not the target) via `SourceAuraSprite` component. 3s duration (300ms fade in, 2.4s hold, 300ms fade out). `sourceAuraGlow` CSS keyframe
- **Muted Tile Overlay:** SILENCED label + desaturation wash on muted guest tiles. Tracks `mutedSeats` state from `muteGuest`/`unmuteGuest` events. `MutedTileOverlay` component with `silencedLabelIn` CSS keyframe
- **STFU cooldown timer:** global 10s lockout after any STFU is played. Countdown displayed on card button with `cooldownPulse` border animation. Prevents retaliation
- **WRAP IT UP card:** third card added (orange #ff7700). Time's up / nudge speaker. `CardColor` type extended with `"orange"`
- **SFX system:** card sound effects for STFU, MIC DROP, WRAP IT UP. Preloaded and cached, cloned per playback for overlap. `sfx.ts` library
- **Buzz-in panel:** `BuzzPanel` component, buzzer auto-off timer

### Changed
- Buzzer auto-off: 30s to 120s
- STFU mute duration: 5s to 10s
- SFX volume: stfu 0.4, micdrop 0.4, wrapitup 0.4 (source files pre-attenuated at 50% at encode time)
- Card center-screen announce: 3s to 6s (camera animations stay at 2.5s)
- WRAP IT UP color: yellow (#ffcc00) to orange (#ff7700) to avoid clashing with gold source aura
- STFU card alarm volume reduced to 40%

### Fixed
- STFU stacking orphan overlay bug: per-seat mute reasons system prevents orphaned SILENCED overlays when STFU is stacked
- `reconcileMic` stale closure: changed from `useCallback` to `reconcileMicRef`
- Over-engineered circuit-breakers: consolidated into single interval checking `hostMutedRef || stfuMutedRef`
- `muteCooldownDone` retained as no-op handler for backward compatibility

---

## [Phase 1-5 Hardening] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Per-seat mute reasons:** dual-flag system (`hostMutedRef` + `stfuMutedRef`) with single circuit-breaker. Fixes STFU stacking permanently silencing a guest
- **React.memo on all sprite components:** `EmojiFloat`, `StfuCard`, `MicDropCard`, `WrapItUpCard`, `SourceAura`, `MutedTileOverlay` — prevents unnecessary re-renders in OBS Chromium
- **Single sweep removal:** unified cleanup effect replaces multiple `setTimeout` calls for sprite removal
- **Self-hosted fonts:** Orbitron 900 and Inter self-hosted at `/fonts/` instead of Google Fonts CDN. `font-display: optional` prevents mid-animation font swap
- **Code-split routes:** `React.lazy` per route. Overlay JS bundle reduced to roughly 1/3 size
- **Payload validation:** runtime guard on inbound data-channel payloads. Validates event types, seat IDs, emoji strings, card IDs, string lengths, number finiteness
- **Debug HUD:** `?calibrate=1` or `?debug=1` shows connection status chip on overlay
- **Data-channel health:** `lastEventAt` tracking, connection-status rendering in debug mode

### Changed
- DRY: `EMOJI_COLOURS` extracted to shared module in `emojis.ts` (was duplicated in PlayRoute + OverlayRoute)
- DRY: `SEAT_ORDER` deduplicated into `coords.ts`
- DRY: `buildIframeUrl` and `buildHostIframeUrl` were byte-identical — deduped in Phase 5.3
- Multiple `setTimeout` for sprite removal replaced by single sweep interval

### Fixed
- `reconcileMicRef` stale closure: ref-based approach avoids `useCallback` dependency churn
- Circuit-breaker race condition: single interval checking both flags eliminates race
- Host mute visual override by STFU expiry: dual-flag system means host mute persists independently

---

## [v1.2-staging] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- STFU dim wash changed from near-black to bright red (`rgba(220,0,40,0.55)`)
- Chat logging pipeline added to `vdoninjaChat.ts` to diagnose HTML parsing issues

### Fixed
- **Chat HTML bleed RESOLVED:** parser now handles all VDO.Ninja message shapes. Raw HTML no longer renders in chat panel
- Animation sizing on rounded camera windows: overlays now render correctly against inner cam shape

---

## [v1.2] — 2026-05-22 (PRs #16-22)

### Added
- **Guest layout fix:** added `&broadcast` to guest iframe URL — fixes layout breaking when multiple guests join
- **Animation polish v2:** MIC DROP green theme (#00d96b) + falling mic animation, STFU intensity boost
- **Producer auth:** `localStorage` password gate on `/producer` route. `gamified.auth.v1` key. OBS Custom Browser Docks retain auth across restarts
- **Editor role:** `?role=editor` variant — audio-only publish via `&videodevice=0`, chat-only panel, excluded from card target pickers
- **Host + editor single-URL pattern:** director/codirector privileges baked into one URL

### Fixed
- **Card reset bug RESOLVED (PR #26):** producer joins overlay context as "dataonly codirector" for bidirectional data flow. Cards now propagate per-guest correctly across tabs. Previous attempts (localStorage epoch, ref-pinned listener, `&novideo&noaudio&push`) all failed

### Changed
- Chat HTML parsing: DOMParser-based sanitizer for VDO.Ninja's `<b><span>` message format

---

## [v1.1] — 2026-05-06 (PRs #11-15)

### Added
- Animation polish v1: `slamIn` keyframes, mic fall animation
- Header rework: GAMIFIED wordmark moved to top center between guest label and LIVE indicator
- Producer panel section reorder: roster, calibration, reset, activity
- Chat extraction in wrapper: input + emoji picker + send button

### Fixed
- Card reset bug: epoch comparison attempt (did not solve the bug)

---

## [v1.0] — 2026-05-04 (Phases 1-7)

### Added
- **Phase 1:** Repo cleanup — legacy Socket.IO server removed, unused routes deleted (LoginRoute, ProducerRoute, HostRoute, OverlayRoute, ContestantRoute)
- **Phase 2:** Config files — `src/coords.ts` (tile coordinates), `src/emojis.ts` (12 reaction emojis + 15 chat emojis), `src/cards.ts` (STFU + MIC DROP)
- **Phase 3:** VDO.Ninja iframe wrapper library — `src/lib/vdoninja.ts` (postMessage API, sendData broadcasting, event type system)
- **Phase 4:** `/play` wrapper route — VDO.Ninja iframe + emoji panel + card panel + target picker modal
- **Phase 5:** `/overlay` route — transparent OBS browser source, emoji float animation, STFU + MIC DROP card animations
- **Phase 6:** `/producer` route — roster names, reset cards, activity feed, calibration mode
- **Phase 7:** Deployment polish — `_redirects`, `_headers`, Cloudflare Pages setup, show-day documentation
- VDO.Ninja chat library: `src/lib/vdoninjaChat.ts` (websocket-based chat, DOMParser sanitization)
- Auth library: `src/lib/auth.ts`
- SFX library: `src/lib/sfx.ts`

### Architecture
- Static site on Cloudflare Pages, no backend server
- Real-time via VDO.Ninja P2P data channels (`sendData` API)
- Three surfaces: guest wrapper, OBS overlay, producer panel
- 1920x1080 canvas, tile coordinates measured from actual OBS scenes
