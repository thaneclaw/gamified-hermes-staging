# Gamified

A real-time gamification overlay system for a weekly video gameshow. Six rotating
guests, one host, one producer running OBS. The project adds a thin static layer
on top of the existing VDO.Ninja + OBS setup.

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for current architecture rules, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
for historical decisions and failed approaches, and [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)
for version history.

## What it adds

- **Guest wrapper** (`/play`) — iframes VDO.Ninja, adds reaction buttons, cards,
  emoji picker, chat, and buzz-in
- **OBS underlay** (`/underlay`) — transparent browser source beneath camera
  layers. Renders emoji floats, card animations, STFU silenced overlays, mute
  indicators, and calibration grid
- **OBS overlay** (`/overlay`) — transparent browser source above all OBS
  sources. Renders chat-to-screen and future top-layer graphics
- **Producer panel** (`/producer`) — dockable OBS panel for roster, buzz board,
  card resets, host tracker, activity feed, and calibration

No backend server. Real-time events ride VDO.Ninja's existing P2P data channels.
Hosted as a static site on Cloudflare Pages.

## Scripts

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build
npm run preview    # serve the production build
npm run typecheck  # tsc only, no bundle
```

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/play` | Guest/host/editor wrapper: VDO.Ninja iframe + cards + emoji + chat + buzz + mute |
| `/underlay` | OBS browser source (beneath camera layers): emoji floats, card animations, STFU overlays, mute indicators, calibration |
| `/overlay` | OBS browser source (top layer): chat-to-screen card, future top-layer elements |
| `/producer` | Dockable producer panel: roster, buzz board, reset cards, host tracker, activity feed, calibration |
| `/chat` | Standalone chat UI |
| `/editorchat` | Chat-only route for editor (default label "Phil") |

## Cards

Three cards, reset by producer between rounds. STFU (1 use), WRAP IT UP (3 uses), MIC DROP (3 uses) per topic per guest. Playing STFU locks both the STFU and WRAP IT UP buttons for 10s. Playing WRAP IT UP does not start any cooldown. MIC DROP is never affected:

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| SHUT THE !@#$ UP (STFU) | Mutes all guests except player for 10s. Locks STFU + WRAP IT UP buttons for 10s. SILENCED overlay on muted tiles. |
| WRAP IT UP! | Orange-themed "time's up" nudge. Locked when STFU is played, but playing it does not start a cooldown. |
| MIC DROP | Gold-themed "crown the speaker" celebration |

## Branches and deployment

| Repo | Purpose | Branch |
|------|---------|--------|
| `thaneclaw/gamified-hermes-staging` | All development and staging | `staging` |
| `lemz0x/gamified` | Production | `main` |

- Feature branches auto-deploy preview URLs via Cloudflare Pages
- `staging` branch auto-deploys to `gamified-hermes-staging.pages.dev`
- After testing, Lemz opens a PR from `staging` to `lemz0x/gamified` `main`
- Production deploys to `gamified-2e9.pages.dev`

## Show day setup

Production lives at `https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev`. The producer holds a short
bookmark list for the day: six guest URLs, one host URL, two OBS browser source
URLs (underlay + overlay), one producer dock URL.

### Guest URLs (one per seat)

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/play?seat=<1-6>&push=<pushID>&label=<GuestName>
```

- `seat=1..6` maps to tiles `L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3` (top-left, middle-left,
  bottom-left, top-right, middle-right, bottom-right).
- `push` is the guest's existing VDO.Ninja stream id. The wrapper iframes their
  existing publish URL; it does not create a new peer connection.
- `label` is what shows in the wrapper header and VDO.Ninja chat.
- Guest cameras publish 1:1 square automatically (`aspectratio=square` + 30fps cap). This saves upload bandwidth since OBS uses square cutouts. No action needed — the wrapper handles it.

### Host URL

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/play?role=host&push=<pushID>&label=Host
```

Host and guest wrappers share the same URL shape — `&broadcast` auto-discovers
the producer's composited Virtual Camera feed. Host is excluded from guest
card target pickers.

### Editor URL

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/play?role=editor&push=<pushID>&label=Editor
```

Editor publishes audio only (`&videodevice=0`), sees chat-only panel, excluded
from card target pickers.

### OBS browser source — `/underlay`

Add a **Browser Source** in OBS pointing at:

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/underlay
```

- **Width / Height:** `1920` x `1080`
- **Custom CSS:** leave empty (body background is transparent via `body.overlay-route`)
- **Shutdown source when not visible:** OFF (data-channel iframe must stay mounted)

This lives in a dedicated `_Overlay` scene added as a nested scene source on top
of every other scene. One peer connection, one render context, no scene-switch
reconnects.

For tile calibration during setup, append `?calibrate=1` to the URL.

### OBS browser source — `/overlay` (top layer)

Add a second **Browser Source** in OBS pointing at:

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/overlay
```

- Place this source at the **top** of the OBS source stack
- Same width/height and shutdown settings as the underlay
- This renders chat-to-screen and any future top-layer graphics

### Producer panel — Custom Browser Dock

In OBS: **View > Docks > Custom Browser Docks**, add a new dock with URL:

```
https://gamified-2e9.pages.dev/producer
```

The panel ships six sections:

1. **Roster names** — set Guest 1-6 names; Save broadcasts to all wrappers
2. **Buzz board** — buzzer controls for each seat. Click a buzzing seat to clear it (useful when a guest's tab crashes mid-buzz).
3. **Reset cards** — clears per-card use counters across all wrappers
4. **Host tracker** — per-seat text inputs, send to host display via P2P
5. **Activity feed** — last 20 events on the data channel
6. **Calibration** — enable coordinate editors, adjust X/Y/W/H per tile, broadcasts live to underlay

The dock is also viewable as a regular browser tab.

### Guest ISO recording (optional)

For recording each guest's camera as a separate ISO feed, see
[`docs/obs-source-record-setup.md`](./docs/obs-source-record-setup.md).
Uses the OBS Source Record plugin to capture individual guest streams
before they're composited into the show output.
